# TEA5767sk
This is repository contains two an Arduino sketches to manage the TEA5767 FM radio on chip with Arduino on I2C
With this sketch you can manage the TEA5767 FM on chip module:
- set FM frequency
- read and write internal registers
- seek
- get PLL and frequency
. print frequency on LCD

LCd module used is compatible with Liquidcrystal_I2C (I have used AzDelivery LCD I2C)

One sketch is simpler, the other adds analog seek of frequency and keypad management
