# TEA5767sk
This is an Arduino sketch to manage the TEA5767 FM radio on chip with Arduino on I2C
With this sketch you can manage the TEA5767 FM on chip module:
- set FM frequency
- read and write internal registers
- seek
- get PLL and frequency
. print frequency on LCD

LCd module used is compatible with Liquidcrystal_I2C (I have used AzDelivery LCD I2C)
